# Team_9_Final_Project

# Overview of the Project

Selected Topic: Unicorn Companies (A startup company with a valuation of above $1 billion)

Reason the topic was selected: 
- The dataset is relative in the current economic environment, as there is an increasing amount os startups opearting in niche markets with most of them turning out to be unsuccessful. This study will help startups understand what variables are important to them being ssuccessful and achieving a viable unique projected value.
- The dataset has a good mix of continuouss and categorical data.
- There are multiple variables realed to each other which makes it suitable for a machine learning model.

Description of the source of data: The dataset was retreived from Kaggle and was put together through web scraping.

Questions the team hopes to answer: 
The team is currently exploring different questions the data can answer. Some of our options include;
- Likelihood that a company that has a projected value of at least 1B will achieve acquisition.
- Whether the investors count affects the valuation of the company.
- If the total raised affects the valuation of the company.

We hope that the machine learning model will extract ineresting relationships or questions that the dataset can answer.
